# P1_CV: My own curriculum vitae

## - Analysis of the project:

__1.  Target user profile__
The profile of the user to whom my website is addressed is for the human resources staff and department heads of any small, medium, large or even multinational company. 

Initially I thought the structure of my resume on the website would be on a single page. But when analysing what information was needed, I thought it was better to separate it by sections, so that depending on the user who consulted it could be more interested in one information than another and access it directly. For example, a human resources technician might be more interested in academic and personal information, however a head of department might focus on work experience and specialization of specific aspects according to the profile of worker you are looking for.

To make my CV I have taken into account the basic structure, such as personal data, academic record, further training and, of course, professional experience. Although I have also included a small introductory text and some projects, such as volunteering, of which I have been part, in addition to my hobbies.

I have also tried to use keywords related to possible jobs that I might be interested in, as I believe that many companies use candidate tracking systems and perform searches using these words.
