# P1_CV: My own curriculum vitae

## - Analysis of the project:

__1.  Target user profile__

The profile of the user to whom my website is addressed is for the human resources staff and department heads of any small, medium, large or even multinational company. 

Initially I thought the structure of my resume on the website would be on a single page. But when analysing what information was needed, I thought it was better to separate it by sections, so that depending on the user who consulted it could be more interested in one information than another and access it directly. For example, a human resources technician might be more interested in academic and personal information, however a head of department might focus on work experience and specialization of specific aspects according to the profile of worker you are looking for.

To make my CV I have taken into account the basic structure, such as personal data, academic record, further training and, of course, professional experience. Although I have also included a small introductory text and some projects, such as volunteering, of which I have been part, in addition to my hobbies.

I have also tried to use keywords related to possible jobs that I might be interested in, as I believe that many companies use candidate tracking systems and perform searches using these words.

__2.  Information architecture__

To design my web CV I have chosen to make a homepage on which my personal contact information is seen with a photograph and a small text as a cover letter. I have opted for a simple design, but that has a style of its own. On this homepage I have placed a navigation menu with different options that allow to quickly select the detailed information of each of the sections of the CV, keeping the personal information and header, and the menu adapted according to the chosen option. A very important point I have taken into account is that with less than two clicks, you can easily access the required information. Another important point is that the information is presented very clearly. Finally, the website that I have made has responsive design adapting to different computer screen formats (I have included those that I have on my desktop and laptop among others), in addition to tablet and mobile.

__3.  Visual design__
I’ve divided the screen into four parts. The header has a background with its own style image, in which I have placed my full name and a logo with border on the left side. I’ve also included a navigation menu with options that give access to specific resume information. I want to emphasize that when passing over the options this is highlighted by displaying an image according to that option so that it has a more visual aspect. The footer keeps my page log. Below the navigation menu I have included a section like main-content, in which I have divided the left part that includes my personal information like name, address, phone and email (with the option to open the mail application). In the rest of the main-content area (right) I have used it for the presentation of the specific information chosen. The header and the navigation menu are the same for all sections of the CV, only changes that when choosing an option this disappears and at the far left of the menu the homepage option appears to return to the main screen. In case the information occupies more space than available in the central area you can continue accessing it in scroll mode, keeping static and fixed the header, as well as the navigation menu. Finally, there is an option with which to get all the curriculum vitae in PDF format, to give ease to the user to have all the information together. 

The colour palette used and the design I have customized to my liking. As for the typography of the text, I have used the family of fonts such as Georgia, Times, serif or Verdana, Arial, serif, among others, with different sizes, styles, shadows...

## - Design proposal with Figma:

I initially made a simpler design in Figma (https://www.figma.com/file/ZgWHdI93zFbItWmBUzahM4/Design_CV_initial), but when I developed my project I saw that I wanted to improve it so it had a more visual appearance, so I made modifications of this initial design, leaving definitely this way:

## - Code of the website:

My project, with the repository name GitHub includes a README.md file, 8 html files (including the index.html homepage, as well as one for each menu option). It also includes a _css directory_ with the styleCV.css file that contains the styles I use in all the format I give to my Web. In addition, it has 3 more directories, _imatges_ (containing all the images used necessary),_pdf_ (with my resume in this format) and _figma_ (with my initial design and the final design of my curriculum vitae webside).
